# The clue is that data should be wrapped with meta-information about connection to the
# next element. In our implementation is the Node object. Deletion in double linked list
# is faster than in single linked. With a doubly linked list you have ready access to both
# elements because you have links to both of them (see DELETE). This assumes that you
# already have a pointer to the element you need to delete and there is no searching involved.

# Search is O(n), Insert and Delete are O(1)

# Code highlights:

# L.next and L.prev points to the object Node not to its particular field. In this way
# we can use 'head' as a temp variable in INSERT. Treat 'head' as the last element.
